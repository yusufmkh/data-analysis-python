This project is focused on analysing the London Fire Brigade dataset to uncover essential patterns and correlations that address the real-world problem concerning fire incidents. The report will start with explaining the methodology, definition of keywords, and importing the dataset. After this, the methodology - CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) will be followed where the dataset will be examined within its business context to identify meaningful problems that can be addressed by using analytics, followed by data exploration to understand more about the data. Next will be data preparation and then modelling. Finally, an evaluation and summary of findings will be produced.
